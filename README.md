FeedBack - Guitar Hero Engine/Editor
====================================

Here lies the original 'FeedBack' Guitar Hero custom song editor that spawned a craze of custom cong creation for the popular Guitar Hero and Rock Band games.

I have since started a new ['FeedBack' project](https://github.com/FeedBackDevs/feedback) which will implement all of my ideas from the time I started the project back in GH1 days. It will feature a full game mode, and support for many more instruments.
This remains here for nostalgia, or future hackers interested in tweaking the original tool.

The original builds are all there: https://github.com/TurkeyMan/feedback-editor/tree/master/Builds
When you click on a build, it will say it can't display it in the browser; choose 'raw' and your browser should attempt to download the file.
