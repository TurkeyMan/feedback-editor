FeedBack ToDO
-------------

General ToDo:
-------------

Define and release an updated '.chart' spec
 - New spec includes all new features including vocals and drums
   * HOPO identification
   * Slide identification
   * Vocal events
   * Drum change events
   * Drum sample listings (do we want to draw 'default' drum samples from the active theme?)
   * Lots of other things...
 - Also define new format rules
 - Clearly define how song specific album covers, fretboards, theme elements, etc are selected (ie, acceptable directory structure/etc)
 - Should aim to 'replace' but still must not conflict with FoF distribution rules


Editor:
-------

Editor needs to be reworked into commands
 - Undo/Redo stack

Arbitrary hotkey -> Command mapping
 - Maybe just an event placement mode, using the numbers?

'sections.txt' should populate the 'Place Section' dialog

'Clear track data' in the menu (like 'Copy track data')

Windows clipboard support for the actual note data (not just strings)
 - Paste chart segments in between different charts, or into txt files

Quit save prompt

Drum track needs to appear like a drum track
 - And drums require configurable samples and sample changes at arbitrary points in the track
 - Replace claps with drum sample triggers
 - Ability to mask particular drum tracks

Enhance note placement logic to support extended features
 - HOPO placement, hold hopo's, hopo after chords...? + Something to visualise that it's been changed
 - 'GH:WT' features.. *Grrrr .. Slide notes
 - RB features (drum fill, Overdrive, solo)
 - Feature to toggle between enhanced and 'GH2' note placement rules

Fingering editor
 - Separate editor window showing fretboard for complex hand placement
 - Support simple backwards compatibility with GH games

Fretboard overlays
 - Waveform (requires DSP support in the audio subsystem)
 - Spectrum analysis (needs an FFT DSP)

Vocal track editor
 - Horizontal track, render fret lines
 - Visualise chromatic scale as 12 distinct rows
 - Show tuner on screen (as people sing a note, it will show the note they are singing to assist plcement)


Frequent Requests:

Lighting visualisation
 - This can come later after game mode exists and we're rendering a stage

BPM analyser
 - I don't like the idea of this, countless poor quality charts will follow

Record mode
 - I've been holding out on this for years, don't really want to add it now

Mouse support
 - Yeah, lots of people want this. The Theme/GUI stuff will help this a lot


Bugs:

Pasting notes should delete everythign in the paste range before pasting the notes

Track events should only exist on expert tracks (why are they *track* events if this is the case?)

If there's more than 6 or so event-like items (including section names, track events, and song events) at some position in the song, and E or W is pressed when the cursor is at that position, dB crashes. 

Enclose track events with quotation marks, so that events that have spaces in the text will not be truncated by dB on re-loading the chart (such as "map HandMap_DropD2").

When playing with two tracks open (I.e. reference track), the notes on the active track (the one that is highlighted/selected) are reset fine when playing is stopped, but the notes on the other, passive track become dim (just the ones that scrolled past while playing the song).

Game Mode Stage 1 (Get it working!):
------------------------------------

Theme system design
 - This is the majority of the work
 - Needs to be carefully designed
 - Theme scripts configurable by ini or xml files
 - Consider StepMania skinning system for inspiration
 - This is required before virtually everything else...

Main Menu screen
 - Show the main menu as a HUB to other screens
 - Simple starting point to test the theme/skinning system
 - Connects
   * Start Game
   * Options
   * Editor
   * Quit
   * (more features later, it band creation, character editor, etc)

Options screen
 - Options including:
  * Theme settings
    - Theme selection
    - Basic theme configuration
  * Gfx options
    - Fullscreen, resolution, quality settings, etc
    - Gfx driver selection (D3D/OpenGL/etc)
  * Audio settings
    - Sound driver
    - Sync source option
    - Levels, etc
  * Controller config
    - Most controllers are auto-configured
    - Association with players
    - Mic settings/PC input selection
  * Language selection
  * Load/Save/Network stuff
    - Load/save, directories, songs location, etc

Song Selector screen
 - Themes need a way to expose the song database, and produce a skinable song selection screen
 - Songs should be grouped into 'groups', allowing separation of GH1, GH2, GH3, DLC, etc song lists
 - Groups need a way to dictate subgrouping ('Your First Gig', 'Face Melters', etc)
 - Songs should each support an album cover image, if it's missing, use the group image
 - Alternate sort modes to list by group, all songs alphabetically, most played, etc

Gameplay screen
 - Gameplay logic exist, used in editor during playback
 - Player note detection code needs work
 - HUD needs to be implemented (Theme/skinning system should solve this problem)


Game Mode Stage 2 (Features):
-----------------------------

Vocal support
 - Needs audio input system and a DSP for pitch detection
 - Needs presentation work, the worm!!
 - Needs editor support

Highscore screen
 - Will connect to scorehero in the future

Band configuration screen
 - For multi-user score tracking

Practise mode
 - Whee!


Game Mode Stage 3 (Polish):
---------------------------

Ingame DLC screen
 - Connect to customhero.net/scorehero.com and list custom tracks available for DLC
 - Auto-download the music if it's freely available (For instance, demo tracks on band websites)
 - Charts with freely available songs should be encouraged to list the URL to the mp3 in the .chart file

Ingame HighScores
 - Connect to the scorehero score database, and display/submit scores with feedback as a supported 'game'

Show a 3D stage and characters
 - By the time we reach this stage, the game will be playable, and i'll be able to get professional artists from work!

Character editor
 - Character customisation stuff...
